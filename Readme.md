## Project Description

 - Welcome to the wonderful world of [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development). Whether this is immediately clear to you or not, you have already familiarized yourselves with this process, only, the tests have been written for you beforehand. Now we start on the other side of the fence, where you have no tests, only working code. The goal of this sprint is to get you familiar with writing unit tests for JavaScript code. 

### Initialize Project

- Be sure to `npm install` to include the necessary dependancies. 
- To run your tests run the command over the corresponding directory/file that you're working in. ex. `npm run watch basic-javascript/tests/project-1.test.js`. 
  - This command will actually re-execute every time a change is saved in that file, so you can see you tests improve without having to run the command over and over again. 
- Once you're done with all the tests for that directory, run `npm test directory/tests`.
- Get started in the `basic-javascript` directory then move onto `advanced-javascript` when you're done.
